               I'm an early learner who has been using HTML as well as CSS for quite a while now. Currently I live in Ontario, Canada.
               I have dedicated my time to learning new things and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills.

               During my time as a developer I have learned a lot about HTML and CSS, I have also learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage my projects.
               currently I am working on a project called "My Portfolio", which is a website that I have created using HTML and CSS to help build
               my understanding about HTML and CSS.
